julia set renderer powered by tcell. default constant $$c$$ is -0.8+0.156i

calculated via $$f(z)=z^{2}+c$$

### usage
* first argument sets real component of constant
* second argument sets imaginary component of constant
* arrow keys to move
* plus/minus to zoom in/out
* spacebar to reset position and zoom
